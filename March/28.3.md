**QR Factorization**
Let $A_{m\times n}$ be a matrix of columns, and whose column vectors are linearly independent.
(there are $n$ column vectors, each with $m$ rows)

Then, $A$ can always be factorized as $$A=QR$$where $Q_{m\times n}$ is a matrix of orthonormal vector columns,
and $R$ is an invertible upper triangular matrix ($0s$ on the bottom left).

Let us say the vectors of $A$ are $\{\vec x_1, \vec x_2, \ldots, \vec x_k\}$.
By applying the Gram Schmidt process, we can get a set of orthonormal vectors $\{\frac{\vec v_1}{||\vec v_1||} , \frac{\vec v_2}{||\vec v_2||}, \ldots ,\frac{\vec v_k}{||\vec v_k||}\}$
Let $Q = \begin {bmatrix}\frac{\vec v_1}{||\vec v_1||} & \frac{\vec v_2}{||\vec v_2||}& \ldots &\frac{\vec v_k}{||\vec v_k||}\end {bmatrix}$ 

Since the vectors are orthonormal, we have that
$Q^TQ=\mathbb I$

$R = \mathbb I R = (Q^TQ)R = Q^T(QR) = Q^TA$
and thus, 
$R = Q^T A$

**Eigen Values and Eigen Vectors**

Consider a square matrix $A_{n\times n}$

If 
$$A\vec x = \lambda \vec x$$
for some column vector $\vec x_{n\times1}$ and some scalar $\lambda,$

then $\vec x$ is known as the *Eigen Vector* of $A$ and $\lambda$ is known as the *Eigen Value* of $A$.


**Characteristic Polynomial**
$det(A-\lambda\mathbb I) = 0$

**Characteristic Equation**
$(A - \lambda \mathbb I) \vec x = \vec 0$

**Eigen Basis**
For a given Eigen Value, the set of all Eigen Vectors which correspond to that Eigen Value is known as its *Eigen Basis*. 
**Eigen Space**
The vector space spanned by the Eigen Basis is known as its *Eigen Space*.

**Geometric Multiplicity**
**Algebraic Multiplicity**

It is the number of Eigen Vectors which correspond to a given Eigen Values. 

We are finding the null space of $A-\mathbb I$??!
