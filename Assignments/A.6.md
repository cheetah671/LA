1. Let $m$ and $n$ be positive integers and let $F$ be a field. Suppose $W$ is a subspace of $F^n$ and dim$W\leq m.$ Prove that there is precisely one $m\times n$ row-reduced echelon matrix over $F$ which has $W$ as its row space. 
2. Consider the vector space $P_4,$ which consists of all polynomials of degree $4$ or less with real number coefficients. Let $W$ be the subspace of $P_4$ given by $$W=\{p(x)\in P_4|\space\space p(1)+p(-1)=0, \space\space p(2)+p(-2) = 0\space\space\}$$
	1. Find a basis for $W$
	2. Determine the dimension of $W$.
3. Suppose that a set of vectors $S_1 = \{v_1, v_2, v_3\}$ spans a subspace $V$ in $\mathbb R^5.$ If $v_4$ is another vector in $V,$ then does the set $S_2 =  \{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\}$ still span $V?$ Prove or disprove with a counterexample.
4. Let $V$ and $W$ be subspaces of $\mathbb R^n$ such that $V\cap W =\{\vec0\}$ and dim$(V)+$dim$(W)=n.$ Prove the following:
	1. If $v+w=0,$ where $v\in V, w\in W,$ then $v = 0$ and $w = 0.$
	2. If $B_1$ and $B_2$ are bases for $V$ and $W$ respectively, then $B_1\cup B_2$ is a basis for $\mathbb R^n.$
	3. If $x \in \mathbb R^n,$ then $x$ can be written as $x = v+w$ for some unique $v\in V, w\in W.$
