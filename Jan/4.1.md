**Fields**
A set $F$ of elements {${x, y, z, ......}$} along with two binary operations (addition and multiplication), satisfying the following conditions is a Field. 
1. addition is commutative
	   $x + y = y + x$       $∀ x, y ∈ F$  
2. addition is associative
	   $(x + y) + z = x + (y + z)$    $∀ x, y, z ∈ F$
3. $∃$ a unique element $0$ (zero) in $F$
	  $x + 0 = x$      $∀ x ∈ F$
4. $∀x ∈ F,  ∃$ a unique element $-x$
	   $x + (-x) = 0$
5. multiplication is commutative
	   $x ⋅ y = y ⋅ x$      $∀ x, y ∈ F$
6. multiplication is associative
	  $(x ⋅ y) ⋅ z = x ⋅ (y ⋅ z)$       $∀ x, y, z ∈ F$
7. $∃$ a unique element $1$ (one) in F
	  $x ⋅ 1 = x$
8. $∀x ∈ F, x ≠ 0, ∃$ a unique element $x^-1$
	   $x ⋅ x^-1=1$
9. multiplication is distributive over addition 
	   $x ⋅ (y + z) = x ⋅ y + x ⋅ z$     $∀ x, y, z ∈ F$

The elements of a field are called scalars.

A minimal non trivial field is ({$0,1$}$, +, ⋅$).

| + | 0 | 1 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |

| ⋅   | 0   | 1   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   |


The difference between this and a complex field is that here the characteristic is 0; No matter how many times you add 1, you will not get 0.

**Subfield**
Let $(F, +, ⋅)$ be a field. Then $(S, +, ⋅)$ is a subfield of $(F, +, ⋅)$, if and only if
1. $(S, +, ⋅)$ is a field
2. $S⊂F$



**System of Linear Equations**
$F$ is a field. Consider the problem of finding $n$ scalars which satisfy the conditions:
$A_{11} x_1 + A_{12} x_2 + ........ A_{1n}x_n = y_1$
$A_{21} x_1 + A_{22} x_2 + ........ A_{2n}x_n = y_2$
.
.
.
.
$A_{m1} x_1 + A_{m2} x_2 + ........ A_{mn}x_n = y_m$



$A_{ij}∈F$    $∀ 1 \le i\le m, 1\le j\le n,$

$y_{i}∈F$   $∀ 1\le i\le m$

$m$ linear equations and $n$ unknowns
Any tuple $(x_1, x_2,......x_n)$ that satisfies the above is a solution to the system.
If all $y_i = 0$       $(1\le i \le m)$, then the system is homogenous.

**Elimination Technique for a Homogenous system**
Consider 
$2x_1-x_2+x_3=0$  ...........(1)
$x_1+3x_2+4x_3=0$ ..........(2)

$-2⋅$(2) $+$ (1) ⟹ $-7x_2-7x_3=0$ ⟹ $x_2=-x_3$
$3$(1) $+$ (2) ⟹ $7x_1+7x_3=0$ ⟹ $x_1=-x_3$

$∴x_1=x_2=-x_3$
